We will use Software Carpentry teaching material, here is the link to the lesson

### Hands-on Python 

#### Setup 

1. Connect to the server as described [here](../WiFi-SSHinstruction.md) 
2. In your home make a folder that you will use for all the python. Use a meaningful name *be consistent and descriptive*  


See suggestions for naming [here](https://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/data-best-practices/best-practices-file-naming)

3. Download the toy-dataset and the code from here using wget 

#### From now we will follow the Software Carpentry lessons
