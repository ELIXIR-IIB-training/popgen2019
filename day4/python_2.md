#### Software Carpentry lessons 

Also today we will use the [Software Carpentry lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) to learn Python. 


We will go through the SC Python lessons that can be found [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) using the data we downloaded yesterday 


In particular we will use material from the lessons: 

- [Repeating Actions with Loops](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/02-loop/index.html)

- [Storing Multiple Values in Lists](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/03-lists/index.html)

#### Objectives of today's lesson 
- Make conditional statements 
- Lean to write and debug functions 
- Understand why to use single-purpose functions in a programme
