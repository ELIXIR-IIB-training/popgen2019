# InfiniteSites.txt - illustration of some concepts using the infinite sites model

# Relation between sample size and expected number of SNPs

# First construct a vector for the sum of 1/i

sum<-rep(0,100)
for (i in 1:100){
   for (j in 1:i){
      sum[i]<-sum[i]+1/j
   }
}

# For theta=10, plot the expected number of SNPs for a range of sample sizes

theta<-10
ExpNumSites<-sum*theta
SampleSize<-seq(1,100)

plot(SampleSize,ExpNumSites)

# Given count of SNPs, estimate theta (Watterson)

# ASSIGNMENT 1: Suppose you observe 52 SNPs in a sample of 100 individuals.  
# Use the Infinite Sites model to estimate theta (this is known as the 
# Watterson estimator of theta). What if there were 26 SNPs instead of 52?   
# What if the sample size was 50 instead of 100?

#ANSWER:

theta<-52/sum[100]
theta

#  Theta in this case is 10.02

theta2<-52/sum[50]
theta2

#   Theta in this case is 11.55

# ASSIGNMENT 2: See if you can show that the expected number of singletons 
# depends only on theta and (amazingly) NOT on the sample size.

#ANSWER:

# You could do this by direct simulation, but the very best way to demonstrate 
# this requires the neutral coalescent, and appears in 
#
#      Fu and Li (1993) Statistical tests of neutrality of mutations. 
#      Genetics 133:693-709.

# This will be covered on Sunday afternoon!
